BTV is the set of tests that run to verify that the build is testable before released to test team for testing.


A defect life cycle goes through different states in its entire life cycle.It starts when defect is detected by the teser and ends when tester closes the defect so that it wont be created again.

Test design is a process that describes how the  testing should be done. 



SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern.Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses.


Selenium is an open source tool used for the automatinon of the tests to be carried out on web browsers which are the web application.

Load Runner is automation load testing tool which allows you to test application before,durinhg and after deployment.Selenium is not just a single tool but a suite of software, each with a different approach to support automation testing.

Yes.
